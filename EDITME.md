The computer AI plays randomly, so this version of Coerceo is not very interesting to play...  
This is the first time I used 3d models, so it took me a while to setup, and unfortunately I didn't have enough time to do everything i had in mind (more 3d animations, UI display).  
However, i learned a lot working on this, and i am grateful to Codelympics for giving me the motivation to create a project and carry it as far as possible !
